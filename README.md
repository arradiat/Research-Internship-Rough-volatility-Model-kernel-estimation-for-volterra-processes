# Research-Internship-Rough-volatility-Model-kernel-estimation-for-volterra-processes
I realised a research internship at the laboratory of mathmatics and mod√©lisation of Evry (LaMME) during my last year of BSc in applied Mathmatics. I worked on rough volatility model with kernels Defined by a sum of exponentials I determined a proper way to simulate the model and to estimate its parameters
